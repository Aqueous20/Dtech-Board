# PulseBoard — Product Definition

## 1. Overview
PulseBoard is a real-time analytics dashboard for startups and product teams
to track user behavior, events, and product performance in a simple,
lightweight interface.

The goal is to provide core insights similar to tools like Mixpanel or
Amplitude, but in a simplified, developer-friendly way.

## 2. Problem Statement
Early-stage startups often lack visibility into how users interact with
their product. Existing analytics tools are either too expensive,
overly complex, or difficult to customize.

PulseBoard solves this by offering:
- simple event tracking
- real-time user activity
- basic funnel analysis
- clear data visualizations

## 3. Target Users
- Startup founders
- Product managers
- Growth engineers
- Indie hackers

---

## 4. Core Features (MVP)
These features define the first usable version of PulseBoard.

- User authentication
- Event tracking API
- Live active users counter
- Events per day chart
- Date range filtering
- Funnel creation and analysis

---

## 5. User Stories
As a product manager, I want to see how many users signed up today.
As a founder, I want to track which features are used most.
As a growth engineer, I want to measure conversion between steps.

---

## 6. Non-Goals (for MVP)
These are explicitly out of scope for the first version.

- Billing and subscriptions
- Team collaboration
- Alerts and notifications
- Mobile app

---

## 7. Success Metrics
PulseBoard is considered successful if:
- events are tracked in real time
- dashboards load under 1 second
- funnels show accurate conversion rates
- system supports at least 10k events/day
